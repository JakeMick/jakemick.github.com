Few of us buy one on an impulse. You decide that
you're going to buy a car, you narrow it down to a few models and you're
almost ready to pull the trigger when you get a massive salary bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And someone eBay sniped your vintage KeyTar for $800 less than it was worth.
Your daughter needs braces. Your wife wants another child. Pooch blew
through your savings on online Poker.(d3vil_Bernard2004)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ye olde cocktail napkin shows that you're less $200/month. Your neighbor Dave
is at the bar. He's bursting with joy. Turns out his patent on a
Jump-To-Conclusions mat finally paid out. He offers you a ride home in his
Candy Red Camaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is crazy. Your monthly budget oscillates wildly with what you can
afford in a car. You're getting sick of splitting the Mom-mobile though,
so you cut work early and sign the papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is our attempt to explore the trends in the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="car-sale-daily.png" class="align-right" src="car-sale-daily.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magenta line is the 100,000's of car sales we processed each day in 2011.
Sales jumps up and down consistently depending on where we on in a month.
There doesn't appear to be a trend for different seasons. The trend seems to
vary with the day of the month we're on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="car-sale-daily-trend.png" class="align-right" src="car-sale-daily-trend.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking just at the trend it becomes apparent that the there is a massive
200,000+ swing in sales that takes place through the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="car-sale-daily-trend-monthy.png" class="align-right" src="car-sale-daily-trend-monthy.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can zoom in on the trend for a given month. Right around the 10th there's
a spike in sales. Followed by a slow decline to the low around the 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
