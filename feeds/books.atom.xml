I read so much
$LaTeX$ that I speak in $\int$s. Sadly though, I haven't contributed much
besides some questions and answers on StackExchange and technical subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 will be the year that this changes. I downloaded a copy of
&lt;em&gt;Technical Blogging.&lt;/em&gt; It has been a joy to read. The book is written in a style
similar to the documentation surrounding a programming framework or library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;That came as no surprise given what the publisher had to say:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Technical Blogging is the first book to specifically teach programmers,
technical people, and technically-oriented entrepreneurs how to become
successful bloggers. There is no magic to successful blogging; with this book
youâ€™ll learn the techniques to attract and keep a large audience of loyal,
regular readers and leverage this popularity to achieve your goals.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that that is out of the way, the rest of this post is aimed at being as
&lt;strong&gt;meta-edgy&lt;/strong&gt; as I possible can, abusing &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; while
writing a review of &lt;em&gt;Technical Blogging&lt;/em&gt; on a technical blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;. So let's get down to the d33ts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book starts off with a solid introduction establishing the purpose of blogging,
going on to say, "Blogging isn't dead ... Blogging is ... Here's how this book fits in ..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapters that follow are self-contained units that encourage you to answer questions
about the blog idea you have in mind. The author suggests writing down a plan of action
as you parse the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapters give you advice on WordPress then go on to give Dos-and-Donts
about SEO, content creation, post consistency, reading Google Analytics, building a
following, growing your blog and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the title I had expected the book to be focused on writing, but it is a small fraction
of the book. The author agrees that content is the most important aspect of a blog
but most of the book is devoted to the details surrounding a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is imbues a fascinating mindset to approach blogging. I hadn't expected
to come across a section on pay-scale for bloggers or job boards. It's like I'm
reading something I shouldn't be allowed to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techical Blogging: Turn Your Expertise into a Remarkable Online Presence
by Antonio Cangiano&lt;/em&gt; is offered by The Pragmatic Bookshelf at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pragprog.com/book/actb/technical-blogging/"&gt;PragProg&lt;/a&gt;. I
would definitely recommend the book to anyone interested in blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(BTW, reStructuredText looks sweet in Vim.)&lt;/p&gt;
