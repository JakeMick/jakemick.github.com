$LaTeX$ that I speak in $\int$s. Sadly though, I haven't contributed much
besides some questions and answers on StackExchange and technical subreddits.</p>
<p>2013 will be the year that this changes. I downloaded a copy of
<em>Technical Blogging.</em> It has been a joy to read. The book is written in a style
similar to the documentation surrounding a programming framework or library.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>That came as no surprise given what the publisher had to say:</dt>
<dd>Technical Blogging is the first book to specifically teach programmers,
technical people, and technically-oriented entrepreneurs how to become
successful bloggers. There is no magic to successful blogging; with this book
you’ll learn the techniques to attract and keep a large audience of loyal,
regular readers and leverage this popularity to achieve your goals.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that that is out of the way, the rest of this post is aimed at being as
<strong>meta-edgy</strong> as I possible can, abusing <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">reStructuredText</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/">Pelican</a> while
writing a review of <em>Technical Blogging</em> on a technical blog.</p>
<p><em>Phew</em>. So let's get down to the d33ts.</p>
<p>The book starts off with a solid introduction establishing the purpose of blogging,
going on to say, &quot;Blogging isn't dead ... Blogging is ... Here's how this book fits in ...&quot;</p>
<p>The chapters that follow are self-contained units that encourage you to answer questions
about the blog idea you have in mind. The author suggests writing down a plan of action
as you parse the book.</p>
<p>The chapters give you advice on WordPress then go on to give Dos-and-Donts
about SEO, content creation, post consistency, reading Google Analytics, building a
following, growing your blog and so on.</p>
<p>From the title I had expected the book to be focused on writing, but it is a small fraction
of the book. The author agrees that content is the most important aspect of a blog
but most of the book is devoted to the details surrounding a blog.</p>
<p>The book is imbues a fascinating mindset to approach blogging. I hadn't expected
to come across a section on pay-scale for bloggers or job boards. It's like I'm
reading something I shouldn't be allowed to see.</p>
<p><em>Techical Blogging: Turn Your Expertise into a Remarkable Online Presence
by Antonio Cangiano</em> is offered by The Pragmatic Bookshelf at <a class="reference external" href="http://pragprog.com/book/actb/technical-blogging/">PragProg</a>. I
would definitely recommend the book to anyone interested in blogging.</p>
<p>(BTW, reStructuredText looks sweet in Vim.)</p>
